ENTROPY ANALYSIS OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shannon entropy quantifies the consistency and predictability of return distributions for trading signals. Lower entropy indicates more consistent, predictable returns, which is desirable for trading signals.

Entropy measures how evenly distributed the returns are across 5 categories:
1. Large Down (< -2%)
2. Small Down (-2% to -0.5%)
3. Flat (-0.5% to +0.5%)
4. Small Up (+0.5% to +2%)
5. Large Up (> +2%)

A perfectly uniform distribution (all categories equally likely) would have maximum entropy (1.0). A distribution that concentrates returns in fewer categories has lower entropy, indicating more predictable outcomes.

Note: Entropy quantifies consistency, not accuracy. A signal with low entropy may consistently lose money, but it's still predictable. We combine entropy with win rate and statistical significance for a complete quality assessment.

KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR GOLD 1HOUR TIMEFRAME
================================================================================

1. Best Signal: SMA - SMA_50_Bounce
   This signal shows the lowest entropy (0.493), indicating highly consistent return patterns. Combined with a 64.5% win rate, this is the most reliable signal.

2. Entropy vs Win Rate Trade-off:
   Some signals may have moderate entropy but high win rates (or vice versa). Consider the full ranking table to find the best balance for your risk tolerance.

3. Statistical Significance Matters:
   5 out of 5 signals are statistically significant. Prioritize signals that are both consistent (low entropy) and statistically significant.

4. Worst Signal: MACD - MACD_Bullish_Cross
   This signal has the highest entropy (0.985), indicating unpredictable returns. Avoid this signal or use with extreme caution.
